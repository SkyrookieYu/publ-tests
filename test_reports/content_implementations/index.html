    <p>The following content creators and distributors have used <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pub-manifest/">Publication Manifest</a> or <a href="https://w3c.github.io/audiobooks/">Audiobooks</a> to create content for internal use or public/commercial distribution. Where possible, this content has been tested against some of the implementations mentioned in the <a href="../manifest_processing/index.html">Implementation Report</a>. Any produced content that is released for testing can be found in the <code>test_content</code> folder in our <a href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-tests">GitHub</a> repository. For distributors listed below, these organizations have either begun implementing or plan to implement shortly after the release of the Audiobooks specification, and intend to distribute and/or ingest Audiobooks content.</p>

    <p>Please note that a content creator may be listed here and may not share their content publicly, all content creators listed will be confirmed by the chairs and editors of the Publishing Working Group.</p>
